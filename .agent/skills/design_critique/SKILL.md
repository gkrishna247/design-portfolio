# Design Critique Skill

## Purpose
To ensure no "generic" or "cookie-cutter" elements enter the portfolio. Every component must be novel.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Novelty & Unconventionality
- [ ] Does this use a standard grid? (If yes, FAIL)
- [ ] Is the navigation a top bar? (If yes, FAIL - standard navigation is forbidden)
- [ ] Is the layout predictable? (If yes, FAIL)
- **Goal**: "Deconstructed", "Asymmetrical", "Organic".

### 2. Micro-interactions
- [ ] Does the cursor react?
- [ ] Do elements distort/move on hover?
- [ ] Is there fluid motion between states?

### 3. "The Wow Factor"
- [ ] Is there a "Surreal" element (3D, distortion, physics)?
- [ ] Does it feel like a website or an *experience*?

## Instructions for Agent
1. **Analyze**: Look at the proposed design or code.
2. **Checklist**: Run through the criteria above.
3. **Verdict**: 
   - **PASS**: Proceed.
   - **FAIL**: List specific reasons and 3 alternative "wilder" ideas.
