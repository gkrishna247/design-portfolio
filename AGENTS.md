# Portfolio Project Context

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for a high-end, award-winning caliber portfolio website. The goal is to maximize the "Wow" factor using "Deconstructed Layouts" and "Surreal Interactions".

## Specific Requirements
- **Design Trends (2026)**: Deconstructed Navigation, Surreal 3D Interactions, Maximalist Type Collage.
- **Tech Stack**: Vite, React, Framer Motion, React Three Fiber (R3F), Lenis.
- **Performance**: 60fps animations, Code-split 3D assets.

## Agent Guidelines & Personas

### 🤖 Jules (The Builder)
- **Role**: Execute code changes, run tests, manage git.
- **Constraints**:
  - **DO NOT** use the Perplexity MCP.
  - Follow the `new_feature` workflow for every UI component.
  - Always check `eslint` before committing.

### 🪐 Antigravity (The Architect & Researcher)
- **Role**: High-level planning, complex design research, deep architectural decisions.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **ALLOWED** to use Perplexity MCP for deep research (e.g., "latest shader techniques for R3F").
  - Use `design_critique` skill to validate concepts.

## Interactions
- **Design First**: If a design looks "standard", REJECT IT.
- **Why**: Always explain the design rationale in comments.
